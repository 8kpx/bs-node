# bs-node

This is a repo pulled out from BuckleScript's [Node API](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_node_module) ([API here](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/api/Node.html)) so that it can be iterated on independently, in userland. It currently isn't stable! We'll gradually upstream the stable parts back into BuckleScript.
